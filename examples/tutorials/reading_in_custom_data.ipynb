Instance Catalogs get their data from instantiations of the `CatalogDBObject` class defined in the `sims_catalogs_generation` package.  `CatalogDBObject` connects to a database, constructs SQL queries on that database, and formats the query results in a way that `InstanceCatalog` expects.  Generally, if you want to read your own data into CatSim, you will need to\n",

      "\n",
      "Because InstanceCatalog has its own `__init__()` method that needs to be called\n",
      "to set up member variables on which the catalog relies (and because we do not\n",

      "The most important member variable of any <b>InstanceCatalog</b> daughter class is\n",

      "\n",
      "1) assess whether or not they have a method to calculate the column value\n",

      "2) assess whether or not they can directly query the column from their\n",

      "\n",
      "(1) relies on getters.  Literally, the <b>InstanceCatalog</b> daughter class inspects\n",
      "its methods and looks for a method named `get_columnName` (whatever `columnName`\n",
      "actually is).  These methods can perform whatever calculations are necessary\n",
      "to calculate the values of their returned columns.  They must return numpy\n",
      "arrays of the calculated values.\n",
